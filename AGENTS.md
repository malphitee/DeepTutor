# DeepTutor — Agent-Native Architecture

## Overview

DeepTutor is an **agent-native** intelligent learning companion organized
around a two-layer plugin model — single-shot **Tools** invoked by the
LLM, and multi-stage **Capabilities** that take over a turn — exposed
through three entry points: CLI, WebSocket API, and Python SDK.

## Architecture

```
Entry Points:  CLI (Typer)  |  WebSocket /ws  |  Python SDK
                    ↓                   ↓                   ↓
              ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │              ChatOrchestrator                    │
              │   routes UnifiedContext → selected Capability    │
              │   (defaults to `chat`)                           │
              └──────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         │              │
              ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌────────▼──────────┐
              │ ToolRegistry │  │ CapabilityRegistry │
              │  (Level 1)   │  │   (Level 2)        │
              └──────────────┘  └────────────────────┘
```

All capabilities emit on a shared `StreamBus`; the orchestrator fans
events out to consumers. Runtime settings live in
`data/user/settings/*.json` — project-root `.env` files are intentionally
ignored. The one sanctioned exception is Docker/CI deployment injection of
integration-process env vars via the narrow `INTEGRATION_PROCESS_OVERRIDE_KEYS`
allowlist (see `CONTAINERIZATION.md`).

## Development and Delivery Workflow

All ordinary fixes and development work target the `dev` branch. Start from
the latest remote `dev`, preserve unrelated working-tree changes, implement the
smallest scoped fix, and run relevant local tests before delivery. Once tests
pass, stage only the intended files, create a descriptive commit, push directly
to `origin/dev`, and verify the resulting CI and development-image build. Do not
open a PR to `main` for routine fixes unless the user explicitly requests one.

A push to `dev` publishes development images only to CNB:

- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:dev`
- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:dev-<12-character-commit-sha>`
- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:latest`

Development pushes must not publish images or caches to GHCR and must not create
or move release tags. A successful development publication moves the CNB
`latest` alias to the same verified multi-architecture digest as `dev` and
`dev-<sha>`. The user periodically merges `dev` into `main` manually and creates
release tags manually. Only a version tag whose commit is already contained in
`main` may publish production images. A production tag publishes the same
verified multi-architecture digest to CNB first and additionally to
`ghcr.io/malphitee/deeptutor`; stable tags may update `latest`. Never merge `dev`
into `main` or create a release tag without an explicit user request.

After a successful development-image publication, delivery also includes
upgrading the user's test deployment on SSH host `panel2-tx`. Its 1Panel Compose
project is `/opt/1panel/docker/compose/deeptutor/docker-compose.yml`, service
`deeptutor`, using the CNB `latest` alias. Verify the published image digest and
commit revision before recreating only this service, and retain the previous
image for rollback. Preserve the Compose configuration and its `./data:/app/data`
bind mount; do not stop unrelated services or remove volumes/data. After the
upgrade, verify the running image revision, container health, and frontend/API
availability. Report publication and deployment separately if an upgrade cannot
be completed. This is part of agent-led delivery, not an unattended CI deployment.

### Level 1 — Tools

Single-function tools the LLM picks on demand. Four user-toggleable tools
surface in `/settings/tools`:

| Tool           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`   | Breadth-first idea exploration with rationale |
| `web_search`   | Web search with citations                     |
| `paper_search` | arXiv preprint search                         |
| `reason`       | Dedicated deep-reasoning LLM call             |

The rest are **context-gated**: the chat capability auto-mounts them from
`ToolMountFlags` (presence of a KB, attachments, sandbox availability, …), and
any of them can also be force-enabled via `--tool`. Auto-mounted set: `rag`,
`read_source`, `read_memory`, `write_memory`, `read_skill`, `load_tools`,
`exec` (sandboxed Python/C/C++ or shell execution),
`list_notebook`, `write_note`, `web_fetch`, `github`, `cron`,
`ask_user` (pauses the turn and resumes with the user's reply), plus the
mastery-path tools. `geogebra_analysis` is parked under
`COMING_SOON_TOOL_TYPES`.

### Level 2 — Capabilities

Multi-stage pipelines that own the turn:

| Capability       | Stages                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`           | exploring → responding (single agentic loop, default) |
| `mastery_path`   | responding (Guided Learning — chat loop + mastery tools, gated per topic type) |
| `deep_solve`     | planning → reasoning → writing                        |
| `deep_question`  | ideation → generation                                 |
| `deep_research`  | rephrasing → decomposing → researching → reporting    |
| `visualize`      | analyzing → generating → reviewing (SVG / Chart.js / Mermaid / HTML; or routes to Manim sub-stages via `render_type`) |
| `math_animator`  | concept_analysis → concept_design → code_generation → code_retry → summary → render_output |

All capabilities converge on `emit_capability_result()` in
`deeptutor/capabilities/_shared.py` so every turn emits the same envelope
(response payload + `cost_summary` from `UsageTracker`). Status copy and
prompts are i18n'd via `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

# Install
pip install deeptutor      # Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  # CLI-only

# Run any capability

deeptutor run visualize "Animate sine wave" --config render_mode=manim_video

# Interactive REPL
deeptutor chat

deeptutor partner list

# Knowledge bases, memory, server
deeptutor kb list

## Dependency Layers

Public install paths and source extras are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Requirements files mirror the same dependency groups for Docker/CI installs.

```
pip install deeptutor      — Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  — CLI-only (LLM + RAG + providers + document parsing)
pip install -e .           — Source install for development

Source extras (.[ extra ], defined in pyproject.toml):
.[cli]            — CLI-only dependency set
.[server]         — Web/API server dependencies
.[partners]       — Partner channel SDKs  (legacy alias: .[tutorbot])
.[matrix]         — Matrix channel for Partners (matrix-nio; needs libolm)
.[matrix-e2e]     — Matrix with end-to-end encryption (matrix-nio[e2e])
.[math-animator]  — Manim addon (powers `visualize` Manim renders + `deeptutor run math_animator`)
.[dev]            — Test / lint tooling
.[all]            — Everything above
```
