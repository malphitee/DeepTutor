# DeepTutor — Agent-Native Architecture

## Overview

DeepTutor is an **agent-native** intelligent learning companion organized
around a two-layer plugin model — single-shot **Tools** invoked by the
LLM, and multi-stage **Capabilities** that take over a turn — exposed
through three entry points: CLI, WebSocket API, and Python SDK. All three
enter the durable turn application service before the shared turn engine
routes a normalized context to the selected capability.

```

`TurnApplicationService` owns durable turn state and replay through the
session store and runtime coordinator. Each execution uses a per-turn
`StreamBus`; the orchestrator emits events, the turn runtime persists them,
and adapters replay them to consumers. Runtime settings live in
`data/user/settings/*.json` — project-root `.env` files are intentionally
ignored. The one sanctioned exception is Docker/CI deployment injection of
integration-process env vars via the narrow `INTEGRATION_PROCESS_OVERRIDE_KEYS`
allowlist (see `CONTAINERIZATION.md`).

## Development and Delivery Workflow

Official release synchronization uses the separate, user-approved workflow in
`docs-for-user/upstream-sync.md`: integrate a pinned upstream release in an
isolated `sync/upstream-vX.Y.Z` branch, confirm conflict decisions with the user,
run the isolation gate and complete CI, then open a PR to `dev`. Do not push a
release sync directly to `dev` or merge its PR without explicit approval.

All ordinary fixes and development work target the `dev` branch. Start from
the latest remote `dev`, preserve unrelated working-tree changes, implement the
smallest scoped fix, and run relevant local tests before delivery. Once tests
pass, stage only the intended files, create a descriptive commit, push directly
to `origin/dev`, and verify the resulting CI and development-image build. Do not
open a PR to `main` for routine fixes unless the user explicitly requests one.

A push to `dev` publishes development images only to CNB:

- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:dev`
- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:dev-<12-character-commit-sha>`
- `docker.cnb.cool/johnnliu/deeptutor:latest`

Development pushes must not publish images or caches to GHCR and must not create
or move release tags. A successful development publication moves the CNB
`latest` alias to the same verified multi-architecture digest as `dev` and
`dev-<sha>`. The user periodically merges `dev` into `main` manually and creates
release tags manually. Only a version tag whose commit is already contained in
`main` may publish production images. A production tag publishes the same
verified multi-architecture digest to CNB first and additionally to
`ghcr.io/malphitee/deeptutor`; stable tags may update `latest`. Never merge `dev`
into `main` or create a release tag without an explicit user request.

After a successful development-image publication, delivery also includes
upgrading the user's test deployment on SSH host `panel2-tx`. Its 1Panel Compose
project is `/opt/1panel/docker/compose/deeptutor/docker-compose.yml`, service
`deeptutor`, using the CNB `latest` alias. Verify the published image digest and
commit revision before recreating only this service, and retain the previous
image for rollback. Preserve the Compose configuration and its `./data:/app/data`
bind mount; do not stop unrelated services or remove volumes/data. After the
upgrade, verify the running image revision, container health, and frontend/API
availability. Report publication and deployment separately if an upgrade cannot
be completed. This is part of agent-led delivery, not an unattended CI deployment.

### Level 1 — Tools

Single-function tools the LLM picks on demand. Seven user-toggleable tools
surface in `/settings/tools`:

| Tool                 | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `brainstorm`         | Breadth-first idea exploration with rationale |
| `web_search`         | Web search with citations                     |
| `paper_search`       | arXiv preprint search                         |
| `reason`             | Dedicated deep-reasoning LLM call             |
| `geogebra_analysis`  | Analyze math images into GeoGebra commands    |
| `imagegen`           | Generate images                               |
| `videogen`           | Generate videos                               |

`USER_TOGGLEABLE_TOOL_NAMES` in `deeptutor/tools/builtin/__init__.py` is the
authoritative toggle list. Other built-ins are **context-gated** or
capability-owned: `CONFIGURABLE_BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES` declares the context-gated
surface, while `deeptutor/agents/_shared/tool_composition.py` owns the mount
rules (`ToolMountFlags`) and the always-available workspace tools. Examples
include `rag`, memory and notebook tools, `read_skill`, deferred MCP/CLI tools,
`exec`, `ask_user`, and mastery navigation. `--tool` selects from the
user-toggleable whitelist; it does not bypass context or capability gates.

### Level 2 — Capabilities

Multi-stage pipelines that own the turn:

| Capability       | Stages                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`           | exploring → responding (single agentic loop, default) |
| `ask_questions`  | responding (chat loop forced through `ask_user`)      |
| `deep_solve`     | responding (chat loop + solve planning tools)         |
| `deep_question`  | ideation → generation                                 |
| `deep_research`  | rephrasing → decomposing → researching → reporting    |
| `visualize`      | analyzing → generating → reviewing (SVG / Chart.js / Mermaid / HTML; or routes to Manim sub-stages via `render_type`) |
| `math_animator`  | concept_analysis → concept_design → code_generation → code_retry → summary → render_output |
| `mastery_path`   | responding (Guided Learning — chat loop + mastery tools, gated per topic type) |
| `immersive_reading` | responding (document-grounded reading loop)        |
| `course_study`   | responding (course-state sensing and hand-off loop)   |
| `immersive_watching` | responding (timestamp-grounded video loop)         |

All capabilities converge on `emit_capability_result()` in
`deeptutor/capabilities/_shared.py` so every turn emits the same envelope
(response payload + `cost_summary` from `UsageTracker`). Status copy and
prompts are i18n'd via `capabilities/prompts/{en,zh}/<name>.yaml`.

## CLI Usage

## Dependency Layers

Public install paths and source extras are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
Requirements files mirror the same dependency groups for Docker/CI installs.

```
pip install deeptutor      — Full app (CLI + Web/API + packaged Web assets)
pip install deeptutor-cli  — CLI-only (LLM + RAG + providers + document parsing)
pip install -e .           — Source install for development

Source extras (.[ extra ], defined in pyproject.toml):
.[cli]            — CLI-only dependency set
.[server]         — Web/API server dependencies
.[partners]       — Partner channel SDKs  (legacy alias: .[tutorbot])
.[matrix]         — Matrix channel for Partners (matrix-nio; needs libolm)
.[matrix-e2e]     — Matrix with end-to-end encryption (matrix-nio[e2e])
.[math-animator]  — Manim addon (powers `visualize` Manim renders + `deeptutor run math_animator`)
.[dev]            — Test / lint tooling
.[all]            — Everything above
```
